# Vue Remember Me app

Practice project from Vue course.

If you want to run my attached code, you need to follow these steps:

<ol>
  <li>Run npm install in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies => This will create a node_modules folder which is missing otherwise </li>
  <li>Run npm run serve to bring up the development server, view the app at localhost:8080 (or whichever port is shown in your terminal)</li>
</ol>
